## Automatic Theme Toggling

The theme automatically toggles dark & light depending on your system's theme.

Included themed components so far:

- ThemeGrommet, overall theme
- CodeBox, `<code>` elements
- FooterHot, a hot footer that sticks to the screen bottom
- Image, takes `imageDark` & `imageLight` URLs as inputs
- useThemeMode, a react hook to get the current theme mode


## Publish to github.io

You may or may not find `npm run github.io` useful. You need to set up github pages in your repo to look in `<root>/docs` folder on main branch.
